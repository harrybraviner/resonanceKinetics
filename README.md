Resonance Kinetics
==================

This code is intended to produce animated plots of the kinetatics of
orbital resonances.

Currently the code is just a skeleton that does a tiny bit of animation.

Features that need to be added in the immediate future are:
* replace 1 with r()
* add the asteroid
* add option to switch between co-rotating and inertial frames
* add solid point at the end of faint line
* control the time-resolution
* control the length of the trailing line (plot entire orbit?)
